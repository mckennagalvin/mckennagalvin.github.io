Greetings from London!

The study abroad program I'm doing is with the University of California Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), which is for all study abroad students within the UC system. I'm currently in the middle of the program's three-day orientation for the ~150 UC students studying abroad in the UK.

My flight from SFO took about 10 hours. I got upgraded to business class, so I got to sit on the upper level of the 747 plane, and had a chair that could lie flat for sleeping! I purposely didn't get much sleep the night before so I would be able to fall asleep on the plane. Although I didn't end up getting much sleep, I watched a lot of movies and the time passed pretty quickly. We got a 3 course dinner and breakfast that were also pretty good!

When the flight landed, I met up with a few other people who were also on my flight and doing the same study abroad program. We took the tube from Heathrow to our orientation session. It was a little busy during rush hour, but overall a much faster (and cheaper!) way to get to our destination than some other options (some people who took cabs said it took them up to 2 hours in traffic)! Walking from the tube station to our accommodation was a little tricky without the comfort of cell service and google maps, but we eventually made it after a few wrong turns. When we got to the orientation location, we dropped off our luggage then walked around for a few hours before we were able to check in.

The first day in London was HOT. They had been experiencing record-breaking temperatures, and the added humidity meant I was pretty much dripping sweat hauling my two suitcases around the streets of the city. I definitely hadn't planned for that type of weather! Luckily the weather was back to its usual, gloomy and rainy self by the next day.

The first thing we did after arriving was go to Three, a UK-based cell phone company. I got a SIM card to use for data, so I now have a new UK phone number. What's nice about Three is that their plan will work in most other European countries without roaming charges, so I can use my data plan when I travel! We found a coffee shop to escape the heat for a bit and use Wifi, then wandered around a little to nearby places like the Tate Modern, St. Paul's Cathedral, and the Borough market.

Day 1 of the orientation wasn't too long, since everyone was pretty jetlagged. There was just a two hour presentation introducing people and giving some general information about the program. Then a couple of people from the US Embassy came and talked about what to do if you get arrested here (lol) and how to vote in the election while abroad. Afterwards, we all went to a local pizza place for dinner. I went home and pretty much crashed right away, since it had been a while since I had been able to sleep.

That's all for now!
