I'm back!

I apologize for the short delay; a lot of stuff has happened this week and I'm just now getting a chance to write a quick post. I'm currently in the middle of Fresher's Week, which is the week before classes start filled with Orientation activities and the like. I have finally taken care of all of the business with grocery shopping, getting bedding, etc., and I finally feel ready for classes to start on Monday!

This past Monday, there was a brief orientation for Study Abroad students, and I went to sign up for an Italian language class afterwards. After waiting in line (sorry, I mean "queuing")Â for 2+ hours, I got to the front of the line to register for the class and was asked to show my student ID card. Because I am an international student, I have to go to a visa check before I can get my student ID. We weren't told that this had to happen before we could register, so I had to travel back to my residence to get my passport, wait in line to get my visa checked, THEN wait in the registration line again to finally register. The whole process must have taken something like 6 hours total. But, I was able to register and now am officially enrolled in the correct number of classes!

The whole administrative process here seems so slow and different. Class registration is all done by hand and through forms, so it's taken forever to get my schedule sorted out. It definitely makes me miss UCLA, where everything can be done online by yourself!

The school also was hosting boat cruises along the Thames river in the afternoon. It was a good way to see some of the main attractions and get an overview of London. I sat next to a few British students and we had a good conversation about how people perceive Americans in England. They knew perhaps more about American politics than I did... really makes you realize how ignorant most Americans are about other countries in contrast!

I've been able to meet all 9 of my flatmates now and have been able to spend quite a bit of time with them over the past few days. People are from all over: California, China, Washington, Germany, Minnesota, Australia, Virginia, England.... Last night we all made avocado pasta together as a flat. I'm looking forward to spending more time with them over these next few months!

Here are some photos of some of the other things I've been doing over the past few days: Impromptu free tea tasting at a tea store called Twinings, exploring the Olympic stadium right next to my residence in Stratford, and Camden market (hipster-y kind of place to the north of central London, reminds me a lot of Venice Beach in LA).
