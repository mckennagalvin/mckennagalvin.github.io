It had only been a little under 3 weeks since I had gotten back from Barcelona with my parents, but I was excited to go back to the city! This time, I prepared myself by watching [music videos from the Cheetah Girls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZpSOSfymV4). It was imperative that I visit all sites shown in that music video.

This time, I stayed in a location farther to the north and closer to the beach. It was my favorite of all of the places we stayed throughout the trip! The hostel's decor was so colorful and fun. It's always so interesting to see the types of people who stay at hostels and the different vibes of each place.

We got up really early in the morning to go to Park Güell, the park designed by Gaudí. We took the metro to get there – luckily Citymapper works in Barcelona! It normally costs 7 Euro to go inside but you can go in for free if you show up before it opens at 8! It was cool being able to watch the view of the sunrise over the city.

After that, we spent the day walking around the Gothic quarter, visiting the Cathedral and Basilica de Santa Maria, and exploring La Rambla, a street in Barcelona with a lot of street performers and market-type shops. The people who hadn't seen the Sagrada Familia before went to see that in the afternoon, so a friend and I went to a cafe that has a bunch of hammocks you can sit on inside. We all met up later at the Palau Nacional to see the light show at the fountain there. It was no World of Color, but it was still pretty impressive!

The next morning, we woke up early again to see the sun rise over the Mediterranean Sea (me??? waking up before noon??? this trip had us all going to bed at like 9 every night to compensate for waking up before the sunrise every day haha). The beach was less than a 10 minute walk from the hostel, so we came back, got breakfast, then checked out for the day.

Since the group was going to check out the Gaudí houses and some of the other stuff I had already seen, I ventured off on my own and walked around the streets for most of the day. One of my favorite places that I went to was the Mercado de La Boqueria, a food market along La Rambla. There was so many cheap foods and squeezed fruit juices – they all looked so good! I got some watermelon juice and a few croquetas. I'd describe them as sort of like mozzarella sticks but instead filled with pureed meat. They were so good! I probably walked around for at least 5 or 6 hours nonstop that day. I was pretty exhausted by the end, but it's always my favorite way to explore the city. I love seeing all of the little quirks of a city along the sides of the streets, something you tend to miss out on by taking the metro or taxi.

Soon it was time to head to the airport to go back home!  As much as I loved our weeklong trip, it was pretty tiring and I was excited to head back to London. Sunday was a much-needed day of relaxation, unpacking, and laundry before class started back up the next day. It was a very fun trip overall!
