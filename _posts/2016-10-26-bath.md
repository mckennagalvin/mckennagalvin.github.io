Every weekend in October so far has involved a day trip to some part of England, and this past Saturday was no exception! Here are some photos from my trip to Bath:

Bath is located directly west of London, about 2.5 hours by train from where I live in East London. Its main attraction is the old Roman Baths -- the Romans built a spa around a hot spring around 60AD, and there's now a museum where you can see the old baths and various Roman ruins. After visiting the Roman Baths, we walked around the town a little bit and explored some nearby parks!
