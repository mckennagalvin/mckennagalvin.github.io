Another weekend, another country! A couple of days ago, I got back from a short trip to Amsterdam with 7 of my flatmates/UC friends.

When planning the trip, we couldn't find many cheap flights. The airport that some of the budget airlines fly into is on the other side of the Netherlands and would have required a 2+ hour bus ride from the airport to the city center, adding a lot to the cost. So after doing some more research, we found a bus from London to Amsterdam that cost roughly 20 Euro each way, a journey of roughly 11 hours. It would save a lot of money and also mean that we would only have to pay for one night's accommodation in Amsterdam! So I picked up some sleeping pills from the store, stuffed a backpack with a blanket and a change of clothes, and arrived at the bus station hoping for the best.

Our bus left at 10:00 p.m. on Friday night. It actually wasn't too bad, since it had power outlets and I had an extra seat next to me to spread out on. Much better than flying! We used the Eurotunnel to cross the English Channel. Even though we arrived at the border by 12:30, we had to wait until 2:30 for the next train across the channel. We stopped at a station where we went through UK border security and waited for our time slot. We didn't go through any other type of immigration stop on the way to Amsterdam, which was kind of disappointing because I wanted to get a passport stamp! Oh well.

The channel crossing took about 35 minutes, and after that the bus made its way toward Brussels, where it picked up some more passengers. After about 3 more hours the bus arrived in Amsterdam at around 9am.

Unfortunately, it rained a lot of the time that we were in Amsterdam, which was sad because I had wanted to rent a bike to travel around the city. We got unlimited passes for the metro/buses/trams (Citymapper works in Amsterdam!! #blessed), which turned out to be a really good use of money because we used them everywhere. Taking the trams was really fun because it was above ground, so you could see more of the city instead of just being underground in a metro. And it provided shelter from the rain!

One of the highlights of the weekend for me was going on a canal cruise. It came with an audiotour that gave some facts about the city and some of the buildings. For instance, a lot of the buildings around the canals were built on wooden piles which eventually started rotting, causing the buildings to sink in certain areas and appear to be falling over. Also, every building has a little beam at the top used for hoisting up furniture because the staircases are too small. The tour was a good way to see the city and learn a little more about its history.

Amsterdam is such a unique place. It almost reminded me of Disneyland (but like, if Disneyland had coffee shops which sell weed and a red light district lol), because it seemed almost fake in a way. It was really cool seeing all of the bicycles everywhere and all of the canals and bridges. It's definitely not your average city!

Another highlight for me was the Van Gogh museum. It was a bit pricey (17 Euro with no student discount booo), and we had to wait outside in the freezing cold for about an hour to get tickets, but I think it was worth it! I'm usually not all too interested in art, but this museum was cool because it gives you a whole narrative of his life. I think being able to learn so much about the context and history of each piece made me appreciate the art much more.

The museum also had a special exhibition with a bunch of Monet pieces. We only got to spend around 2 hours in there before the museum closed but I definitely could have spent longer. I really liked reading all of the explanations which accompanied the art!

The bus ride back was a bit more rough. Someone sat next to me the whole time and I was in an aisle seat, which meant I couldn't lean up against the window to sleep like I usually do. I ended up doing some reading and watching the Man in the High Castle for most of the ride (thank goodness Amazon lets you download TV shows to watch offline). When we got to London at around 6am, I had never been more happy to get off a bus in my life. I'm happy that we're taking the Eurostar to get to Paris next weekend, which should only take a couple of hours!

Despite the weather and the long bus rides, I really enjoyed this trip. Amsterdam is a really interesting city and was fun to visit!
