This was the first trip we booked, but the last one in a series of these weekend trips! Paris is one of those must-see cities and it is so close to London, so I had been looking forward to this trip for a while. After spending every weekend in November traveling though, it'll be nice to relax a little and spend more time in London in the days before I leave!

Saturday morning, I woke up bright and early at 4 a.m. to take the Eurostar into Paris. Only a few of the Underground lines operate that early in the morning on weekends, but we thought we would be fine because the two lines we needed to take to get to King's Cross recently changed to operate 24/7 (spoiler alert: this was not the case!). When we got to Bank station to switch from the Central to Northern line, there was an announcement that the connection we needed wouldn't be running for another hour or so. We didn't have that kind of time to spare, so we tried looking into a bus that would take us to the station instead. After going to one bus stop only to realize that it was closed for construction and frantically running to another stop, we finally made it to St. Pancras Station with one minute to spare before the deadline to check in. Whew!

The Eurostar to Paris is a little pricier than taking a bus, but the journey only takes 2.5 hours, and you don't need to wait to cross the English channel since the train goes straight through. It was a pretty smooth journey and took us close to the city center, where we could easily get on the Metro.

Our first stop was the Musée d'Orsay. Museums in Paris are free for people under 26 living in Europe, which was a nice surprise as we were expecting to have to pay! We spent a good amount of time there, and I especially liked their collection of Impressionist paintings. The building itself used to be a train station and had really interesting architecture. The museum was large but still a manageable size, so there was enough time to look through all of the collections.

After that, we walked through the Christmas market on the Champs Elysées, the main street in Paris. There were hundreds of booths set up along the street, selling crêpes, cheese, gifts, and more. It was so crowded! We walked along the street until it reached the Arc de Triomphe, where we had a ~*~fancy~*~ dinner consisting of McDonald's. (Side note: trying McDonald's in different countries is really interesting! You can order on kiosks which show you the full menu, which varies a lot based on where you are. In Paris, for example, you can order macarons!).

We finished the day off with a cruise along the Seine River. Much like London, which centers around the Thames River, most of Paris' main landmarks are located along the sides of the river. It was a nice way to see the city lit up at night, even if it was pretty cold! On the way home, we got some crêpes which were delicious.

The next morning, we went to the Eiffel Tower! Everyone was pretty tired because some guy in our hostel room got back really late, woke everyone up, made a lot of noise, and had the LOUDEST snore in the world. We didn't bother to try to be quiet in morning when we were packing up to go, haha. We got to the tower about a half hour early, so the line wasn't too bad, and reduced prices were available for students to go to the top. The view was amazing!

Later, we got brunch then headed over to the Lourve, which also ended up being free thankfully. We probably only ended up seeing less than a fifth of the collection there because it was MASSIVE! There was some madness in the room with Mona Lisa as expected, which I don't really understand because it doesn't seem much different from any of the other paintings??? I don't know, maybe I just don't understand art enough. Anyway, all of the rooms inside the Lourve were beautiful, such impressive architecture!

We then went to see the Catedral de Notre Dame and got some dinner before it was time to head back to the train station. After getting a little lost on the Metro to the train station and going the wrong way initially (it feels like the only time we've had issues with public transportation has been when we absolutely need to be somewhere by a certain time), we finally made it, and had a pretty smooth train ride back!

One thing that was definitely noticeable throughout the city was the presence of security and police, especially around major landmarks -- a trend I've definitely noticed in other cities as well, from seeing clear trash bags used for garbage collection to make it harder to leave bombs there to police walking around with huge guns. It's sad that that's the reality of the world we live in today, but I guess it was a little comforting to safety measures being put in place.

I had expected people in Paris to be rude and was bracing myself for the worst, but everyone that we encountered was very friendly, despite our French being limited to the basic hello/thank you/sorry/excuse me! So that was a nice surprise. The city itself is very pretty, with its wide streets and all of the little terraces and balconies on the facades of the buildings. Paris is not a city I could ever see myself living in, but it was still nice to visit. It was a great way to end this series of November travels!
