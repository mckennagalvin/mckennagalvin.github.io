Classes start tomorrow! As much as I've enjoyed setting my own schedule and wandering around London this past week, it'll be nice to get into some kind of a routine. Here's some highlights from the past few days:

This past Thursday, the study abroad program was offering discount tickets to a comedy club, so I ended up going to it with a few other people. When we got to the tube station, however, all of the entrances were blocked off. A guy was standing on the top of one of the ledges and a crowd was gathered below. People weren't really sure if he was protesting or just drunk or something, but either way, it created quite a scene. Apparently someone eventually convinced him to come down by <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/stratford-passerby-talked-down-dancing-protester-on-station-roof-by-offering-him-a-nandos-a3352016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offering him Nandos</a>. Seriously. London doesn't seize to amaze me.

Anyways, we ended up taking an Uber to the place. The show was pretty good!


On Friday, I walked around the British Museum for a bit. It was interesting hearing their take on their reason for having so many sculptures taken from the Parthenon. I think Greece probably has a more rightful claim to them, but either way it was cool being able to see them in the British Museum! Like a true #millennial, I pretty much walked around the museum for a half hour or so, then decided I had seen enough old stuff for the day and left.

Since the university I'll be taking classes at, King's College, doesn't really have a central campus (there are different buildings spread throughout the city), a banquet hall was rented out for Fresher's Fair, which is an Activities fair showcasing all the different "societies" (clubs) on campus. It was huge! Definitely just as big, or even bigger, than UCLA's activities fair, which is certainly saying something.

I ended up joining the Dance Society and went to their free "Taster" day for classes today. It was fun and I definitely plan on going to a lot of the classes while I'm here! Coming from UCLA dance classes which mostly take place in dirty parking lots, it was so nice to be in a space with an actual mirror and clean floors.

I should probably look up where my classes are tomorrow now and see if there are any readings I had to have done... I'm curious to see how British universities compare to American ones and if there are any major differences!
