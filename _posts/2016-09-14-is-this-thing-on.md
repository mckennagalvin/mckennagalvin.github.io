Hello to all my fans (aka the 2 of you out there who will ever read this thing):

I’m currently sitting in SFO waiting for my flight to London, where I’ll be studying abroad for the next three months! This day has always seemed so far in the distance, so it’s crazy that it’s finally here and that this is actually happening. I’m so excited to live outside of California for the first time in my life, though I’m not really sure how I’m going to survive without Trader Joe’s in my life (how does anyone survive without Trader Joe’s?!?! I’m really not sure it can be done).

In an attempt to document my life more (but mostly to reassure my parents that I’m alive so they won’t freak out), I’ll be using this ~*~blog~*~ to keep a record of my life throughout these few months. Going to a new country and living in a city where I know absolutely nobody is a little intimidating, but I’m excited for what’s to come. I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to travel, and I definitely don’t plan on wasting it!

~*~stay tuned~*~<br/>
xoxo gossip girl
