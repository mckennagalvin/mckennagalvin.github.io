After Rome, the next stop was Florence! We took an express train from Rome Termini station on Tuesday and arrived in Florence in about an hour and 15 minutes.

The hostel we stayed at in Florence was huge! It was more like a hotel and had a bunch of amenities, like pools, a gym, and different lounge areas. After checking in to the hostel, we got dinner, walked around the city a bit, then went to bed.

The next day, we started off with a walking tour of Florence. It took us to the major Renaissance landmarks of the city, like the church of Santa Maria Novella, the Duomo, Piazza della Signoria, and the Church of Santa Croce. Once that was over, we took some time to explore the city ourselves.

I had read on google reviews that there was this cool fortress on a hill which offered nice views of the city. After walking up a steep incline for a while, we got there and realized that the place is only open until September during the year. We found one wall, though, that we could climb up a little bit to see the view.

I love how all of the buildings in Florence fall under the same general color scheme. All of the streets and little alleyways seemed almost unreal. Some of the highlights of the rest of the day included getting sandwiches at the popular All’Antico Vinaio shop, witnessing what we think was a reality TV show being taped on the streets of Florence(?), and watching the sun set over Piazzale Michelangelo.

The next morning, we woke up really early to take a train to Pisa! It's one of the cheapest airports to fly out of in Italy, and it's located only about an hour away from Florence.

I'd describe Pisa as a less-pretty version of Florence haha. It seems that the whole economy there is centered around the Leaning Tower. We didn't have too much time there, so we pretty much just took pictures with the tower, stopped at a café for our last taste of cheap Italian coffee, then walked to the airport.
