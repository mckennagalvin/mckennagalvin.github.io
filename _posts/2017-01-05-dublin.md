The last month has been a bit of a blur; between studying for finals, packing to go home, and spending time with family in Southern California for the holidays, I'm just now getting the chance to update this blog! Here are some photos from a four-day trip I took to Dublin after finishing my finals.

I had been to Ireland once before on a trip with my family in 6th grade, but we hadn't gone to Dublin, so I knew this was a city I definitely wanted to visit during my time in Europe. Since Ryanair has its two main bases in London and Dublin, I was able to score really cheap plane tickets -- it was only 22 pounds (about 27 dollars) round trip! Armed with just a backpack full of clothes, I set off to Ireland on Wednesday right after finishing my last final.

It was raining the entire first day that I got there, but luckily it wasn’t too hard finding my hostel. It was right in the middle of the city, which was convenient because I could keep going back there to charge my phone, use the bathroom, etc. I’ve stayed in 8 different hostels throughout my time here in Europe, and I must say that this one was probably one of the best, just after the one in Barcelona! It had a nice common space and good complimentary breakfast.

Dublin isn’t too big of a city, so it was pretty easy to walk around to all of the major sights. On my first day, I walked around Trinity College, the National Museum of History and Archaeology, and National Gallery. The Archaeology museum was really cool because it had pretty much every artifact discovered in Ireland and gives you an entire narrative of Irish history — from the time the Vikings ruled, to its time in the British Empire, to its independence today. I didn’t really know too much about Irish history before coming to Ireland so I enjoyed being able to learn a bit more and see some important archeological discoveries in chronological order. It was definitely a highlight of the day!

On Thursday, I started the day off with a walking tour of the city. The tour guide was great and told a lot of jokes the whole time. Free walking tours are some of the best ways to be introduced to a city! I later ventured off to St. Stephen’s green, a nearby park, and wandered around the eastern part of the city, close to the docks and the water. That part of the city gave off a completely different vibe from the rest of Dublin — there were tons of modern apartment complexes and a lot of tech offices. Apparently Ireland has low corporate taxes, so it’s very attractive to companies since it’s part of the EU and they speak English. This area reminded me a lot of San Francisco and Seattle, with the number of construction cranes that were in the sky and the noticeable tech presence.

One of my favorite parts of the day was visiting a museum called EPIC Ireland. It focuses on the experience of Irish emigrants: what drove them to leave, where they went, and how they impacted the world. They give you a passport that you can “stamp” in every room of the museum, and had a lot of different interactive displays. The whole thing was very modern, and very informative as well! It’s pretty crazy to think about how many people can trace their roots back to this tiny island of only a few million people.

On Friday, I had signed up for a bus tour to the Cliffs of Moher. It left pretty early in the morning, at about 7am, and we didn’t get back until about 8pm. The cliffs are situated on the other side of the country, about a 3 hour’s bus ride. Throughout the day, the bus driver talked about Irish history and told a few jokes and stories along the way — it was a good way to get a comprehensive perspective on Irish life while seeing all of the scenery of the countryside! On the way over, we stopped at a gas station/rest stop for a break in a small town. Apparently Barack Obama has some ancestors that come from that town, and he had visited a few years ago, causing quite the frenzy — apparently enough so that when they built this rest stop a few years after his visit, they decided to name it after him. I’m sure Obama will look back on his achievements and see having a gas station in the middle of nowhere in Ireland named after him being one of his finest.

It was raining in the morning when we left, but it luckily had cleared up when we reached the Cliffs. They were pretty impressive to see! Though the visitor center has a paved area for viewing, it was facing directly into the sun, making it a little hard to see everything. There was a trail a little ways away, however, that led to an area that had a much better view. Since it had just rained, the dirt along the path was really muddy, and the path was only about 2 feet away from the edge of the cliff. Some people ended up slipping in the mud and were walking back with their clothes completely ruined. Luckily, I managed to traverse the path without falling, and I got a pretty good view. On the rest of the bus ride back, we drove along the coastline for a bit and stopped at a few places along the ride back, including a limestone beach area and an old 12th century Cistercian monastery. It was a long day, but it was a great way to see the whole country and well worth the money in my opinion!

On Saturday, I started the day with a tour of Kilmainham Gaol. It's a former prison where a lot of Irish revolutionaries involved in Ireland’s 1916 uprising were imprisoned and later executed. The place has a lot of interesting history and seemed to play a role in nearly every major event in Dublin’s history. I later went to the National Museum of Decorative Arts and History. They had a pretty cool exhibit on currency, and showcased the different currencies used in Ireland and how they changed as Ireland was ruled by different groups. After that, I checked out St. Patrick’s Cathedral and Dublin Castle in the Medieval Quarter of town.

By that point, I had pretty much covered everything there was too see in Dublin! I had a few hours left to spare before my flight was to leave, so I figured I might as well save a few Euros on bus fare and walk to the airport. It was about 7 miles away and took around 2 hours and 30 minutes to get there. Since I only had a backpack I wasn’t carrying too much stuff, but I was still pretty tired once I arrived there and was pretty glad to be able to sit down. Once I got back to London, I had a day to pack before it was time to head back to San Francisco!

This was the last of my little excursions during my time in London, but also my first solo trip. There’s something kind of fun about being completely alone. For one, I could wear the same clothes every day and nobody would have a clue. I got the same sandwich/snack/drink deal for 3.50 Euro from Tesco every day, without having to worry about what other people might want to eat or deal with other people’s food preferences/dietary restrictions. I also felt a greater sense of responsibility about everything — I had to figure everything out myself, from booking a hostel and flight, to figuring out which bus to take out of the airport, to determining where things were and how to get there (though I usually ended up doing the majority of that anyways on group trips — type A personality at work haha).

Luckily, with Google, GPS, and a data plan, there’s not much these days that you can’t do. Don’t get me wrong — I loved traveling with friends the past few months and had so much fun with them, but I did enjoy getting to be a little independent during my 4 days in Ireland. Visiting Dublin was a wonderful way to end my travels in Europe!
