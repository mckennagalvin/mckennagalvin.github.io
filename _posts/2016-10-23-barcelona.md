This past week, my biggest fans (aka my parents) came to visit me! We spent a few days in London then went to Barcelona for 4 days. Here are some of the highlights!

### London: 10/12 - 10/13

One of the best parts about having your parents visit is being able to do more of the things you wanted to do but were too cheap to pay for yourself heh heh. On Wednesday, we saw Matilda the musical. It was really well done – such a unique production! I had forgotten how weird the plot of Matilda is... like there's one part where the headmaster of the school picks up one of the kids and spins her around by her pigtails before throwing her over the fence. The way they reenacted this in the musical was really funny. No wonder my brother was scared of the movie when he watched it! I really enjoyed this; the set looked really cool too!

On Thursday before I had to go to class, we did the Westminster Abbey tour. I had a vague memory of doing this when we went to London as a family 10 years ago, but I think I appreciated it a lot more now that I have more knowledge about the different monarchs and British history as a whole. All sorts of people are buried at Westminster Abbey, including some people you wouldn't expect to be, like Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton. They really crammed all of the monarchs in there – so much so that there's not really any room to bury any more people there. The Abbey itself is really beautiful – such impressive architecture and history!

### Barcelona: 10/14 - 10/17

Our Friday started off bright and early with a flight from Stansted Airport off to Barcelona! Once we got there and grabbed something to eat, we went on a walking tour of some of Barcelona's most popular Modernist architecture – or, as our tour guide liked to call it, GETTING ROWDY WITH GAUDI lol (he was really enthusiastic). The tour visited buildings designed by Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner, and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, the most well-known architects of the Catalan modernism movement of the early 1900s, and concluded with the famous Sagrada Familia.

The Sagrada Familia itself is really impressive – it's absolutely massive and so different from any other building I've seen. On the inside, the light shines through all of the stained glass windows and creates such a beautiful scene inside. We also got to climb one of the towers to see the view from the top. The scale of everything was so impressive; It's estimated that it will be finished in 2026. This was definitely one of the highlights of Barcelona for me!

We finished off Friday with a tour of Casa Batlló designed by Gaudí. This house reminded me a lot of the Little Mermaid for some reason. All of the rooms had a lot of curved edges and cool architectural features. The audioguides that we got were so cool – they used augmented reality technology to show you what the rooms would look like with furniture inside, and the image would adjust based on where you were in the room!

Barcelona is located in Catalonia, a region of Northeast Spain sharing a border with France. I'll have to admit that I didn't even know that Catalonia existed before about a month ago (Oops!) Here I was, thinking that I'd be able to practice my Spanish in Barcelona only to find out that most people in Barcelona speak a language that's more similar to French or Italian... During a walking tour of Barcelona's Gothic Quarter on Saturday, the tour guide spoke a little bit about the history of Catalonia and the Catalan people, which I found super interesting. There definitely seemed to be more of a tie to Catalonia than to Spain throughout Barcelona, which was prevalent in all of the Catalan flags that were hung from several buildings.

We later went to an FC Barcelona game at Camp Nou, aka Dad's main reason for booking a trip to Barcelona (lol how convenient, a game fell right in the middle of our trip!!) We had really good seats and even got to see Messi come in to play at the end. The atmosphere of the stadium was insane. They have a special section at the very top that's all fenced off for the visiting team; it was like they were in a little cage at the zoo to protect them from the crazy Barcelona fans haha. This is a city that takes its football very seriously! Definitely another highlight of the trip for me – this was the better kind of football, for SURE.

On Sunday, we went to Castell de Montjuïc, an old military fortress. The views from the top were insane! We then walked around the city some more and ended the day with a Flamenco show at the Palau de la Música Catalana. This place was designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner and was absolutely beautiful inside – such a cool experience!

Finally, can't forget about the food! We went to a few tapas places here and they were delicious.

### Back to England: 10/17

On Monday, we had an early flight back to London Gatwick, then rented a car to drive into Stonehenge. Mom got a little annoyed by my refusal to take a normal picture.

We then went to Blenheim Palace, just a little bit outside Oxford. This is the place that Churchill was born and which houses the Duke of Marlborough. There weren't too many people there so we got our own little private tour of the state rooms and learned about all of the gossip of the previous Dukes and Duchesses. The grounds and surrounding gardens were incredible! We went there right as the sun was about to set, so the lighting was perfect. Such a pretty place!

Monday was also my 21st birthday! It's a little anticlimactic, turning 21 in a country where the legal drinking age is 18, but it was a wonderful birthday nonetheless! On Tuesday, some of my friends here surprised me with a birthday dinner and cake. I feel so lucky to be here for my birthday, and it was a great way to end a great week! :)
