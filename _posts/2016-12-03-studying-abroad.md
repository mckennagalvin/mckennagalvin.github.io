It’s finals week!

Contrary to popular belief, I actually have been studying and going to class here, haha. I’ve actually really enjoyed my classes here. The system is a lot more independent, so I’ve had a lot fewer assignments throughout the term. That means that my entire grade rests on the final exams, though, which is a little concerning!

Here are some of my thoughts on the “studying" part of "studying abroad", accompanied by a few completely unrelated photos of London that I’ve taken throughout the weeks because WHY NOT


### A brief explanation of British education (might not be 100% accurate, but this is what I’ve learned anecdotally!)

<img class="col two right" src="/img/studying-abroad-1.jpg">

The British education system is actually pretty different from what we have in the US. Once people turn 16, they take GCSE exams, which encompass everything they’ve learned in the two years prior. From there, they can either receive education in the form of vocational education / apprenticeships, or move on to “college” (high school), where they study A levels for two years. It’s a lot more focused than US curriculum, where high school students are generally required to take courses in all subjects. Here, you choose just a few A levels which you want to focus on — it’s typical to take around 3-4.

Since the “courses”/“programmes” (majors) at university often require certain A levels for admission, you pretty much have to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life at the age of 16. For example, <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/computer-science-bsc.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> is a page with the entry requirements for Computer Science at King’s College London, where I’ve been studying this semester. When students apply to university, they usually don’t have their A level results yet, so admission is based on their predicted A level results. When they get their university acceptances, the admission is often conditional, so they must get certain results in order to actually go to that university. If you mess up and get a lower score than you were expected to, you’re kind of short on luck. Sometimes when this happens, people take a gap year and try again.

Once you get to university, a bachelor degree only takes 3 years to complete instead of the 4 that it takes in most other parts of the world. The degree program is pretty rigid; there are no general education requirements, and very few options for electives. When I’ve spoken with a few British students here, it’s a little hard for them to understand why I would take courses outside of my major. That’s one thing that I do appreciate about the American system; there’s a lot of flexibility to explore different subject areas, and to change your mind if you realize that something is not for you. I think I would get pretty burnt out if I were to only take computer sciences classes the whole time I was in college!


### Taking class

It’s been really interesting taking class at an actual British university, and it has definitely helped me feel like a real English person here. In general, the education system is more formal. In-class participation is a lot more rare, and there’s more emphasis on independent learning and doing outside readings. In my classes, I’ve been given a lot of assignments, some of which were turned in weekly and given a grade, but all of it is “formative” and doesn’t actually contribute to my final mark. I’ve found that so weird. Like in my philosophy class, they take attendance every week and we get grades on our problem sets, but it all counts for nothing! So what’s even the point of doing it? I’ve gotten so accustomed to doing everything only because I want a good grade that doing something for the sake of just learning it seems unfathomable to me.

I’m not sure if it’s just King’s College that is this way, but the administrative side of everything has been pretty interesting. Signing up for classes and even figuring out which classes I was allowed to take was such a pain. Everything was done through word documents submitted via email, and it took so long for me to even find out when my exams would be. They didn’t release the timetables for when all of the lectures meet until a few weeks before classes started, after I had already signed up for everything. I’m guessing a lot of this is because usually students just follow a set curriculum, so the schedules are designed to work around a groups of students taking the same 4 courses, but it was quite a pain for study abroad students taking classes in several subjects like myself! Definitely makes me miss UCLA’s course enrollment process.

I feel like I’ve had the perfect amount of outside work this semester. Not too much where I feel overwhelmed or prohibited from exploring London or traveling, but still enough in that I feel like I still have a purpose here, and that I’m not spending these months just aimlessly wandering around a city. It’s given my life here a nice amount of structure, while still having free time.


### My classes

Even though the term here is the same length as a quarter at UCLA (the weeks match exactly up!), it’s still considered a semester, so my classes will transfer back home as being 6 units. I had originally planned to take 2 GE classes here, but realized they would require a lot more essay writing than this science major was willing to do. I decided I would take them back home instead, where I know exactly which classes are the easiest 😃 So instead, these are the classes I’ve been taking while abroad:

<img class="col half left" src="/img/studying-abroad-4.jpg">

<strong>Parallel Algorithms</strong>: This class is pure theoretical computer science — no programming! 😃 It reminds me a lot of the Algorithms class I took back at UCLA, but focuses on how we can exploit a computer’s multiple processors to compute an answer more efficiently. The assessment for this class is just a take-home exam that I’m actually working on right now.

<strong>Computer Vision</strong>: Put simply, computer vision is basically examining how you can extract meaning out of an image, which the computer only sees as a collection of differently-colored pixels. For example, when Snapchat detects your facial features in order to add those filters, how does it do that? The class switches between talking about the biological aspects of vision in the humans (most of which goes straight over my head), and the artificial aspects of vision — how we can model or mimic the actions of human vision via computers. We’ve had to do a few different labs for this class which involved image manipulation and programming using Matlab, which I really enjoyed. A lot of the content of the class is pretty challenging though so I’m definitely going to need to put in some time to understand this class before my final this Thursday.

<strong>Intermediate Logic</strong>: This class was the result of looking for a fourth class to add on which did not require any essay writing, haha. When I went to the first class, I was a little nervous that I would be behind. Everyone in the course had already taken a year of Elementary Logic before this, whereas I had never been taught logic formally apart from a few lectures in an Artificial Intelligence class. Luckily though, I think I caught on pretty fast! A lot of the class is spent doing stuff like axiomatic and sequent proofs, which are pretty fun because they’re basically little puzzles. I think I have a pretty good intuition for that kind of stuff, so I’ve really been enjoying this class.

<strong>Italian 1</strong>: My favorite class! Our teacher has been absolutely wonderful, and it has been so nice being in a small class (fewer than 15 people) for the first time in college. When my friend and I mentioned that we were going to be traveling to Italy, she sent us a long email detailing all the recommendations she had for things to do in Rome, where she’s from. After this class, I decided to sign up to continue taking Italian at UCLA when I return. It’d mean I’d have to take 22 units (5 classes) next quarter, so I’m not sure if I’ll be able to stick with it, but I’m going to try!

Writing this post has been a result of procrastination, so it’s time I got back to working on my Algorithms final. Until next time!
