It's been a while since I last posted! I went to Barcelona last weekend with my parents and I've been taking these past few days to catch up on schoolwork and other stuff I needed to get done. I'll have another post on the Barcelona trip later, but for now, here are some photos from my day trip to Oxford two weekends ago!

Oxford is a little over an hour's train ride from Paddington station in London. We accidentally took a longer train on the way over there that made a lot of extra stops along the way, but made sure to take the express train on the way back! The train ride is pretty scenic along the way; I always enjoy getting to catch some glimpses of the English countryside on the trains.

Oxford itself is a pretty small little college town; there's a main town center with shops, but the main part of the city is the university. There were a lot of students riding around on bicycles, and it was fun walking around to see all of the old buildings. One of my English friends went home for the weekend but lives about 20 minutes from Oxford, so she joined us for the day and showed us around a little bit! We finished the day with some fish and chips in a traditional English pub.
