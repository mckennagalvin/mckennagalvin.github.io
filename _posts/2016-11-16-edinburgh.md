This past weekend I made a trip to Scotland, the kilt-wearing, haggis-eating, bagpipe-playing northern part of the United Kingdom! Edinburgh (pronounced like Ed-in-bruh) is Scotland's capital and second-largest city after Glasgow. My study abroad program hosted a Thanksgiving event there on Saturday for all UC students studying abroad at universities in Scotland, Ireland, and England.

Since I don't have class on Fridays, I decided to take a train over there on Friday and stay an extra night in another hostel (the UC program only provided our accommodation for Saturday night, but most people ended up doing what I did). When I got there, the sun had already set, despite it only being 4pm! Even in London it's been getting dark so early after daylight savings, it's so sad. :( Anyways, I have a friend from high school who goes to school at the University of Edinburgh (as a regular student, not study abroad), so I ended up meeting him for dinner! He showed me around the University and gave me some recommendations for sightseeing in Edinburgh.

On Saturday morning, I did some exploring! I was originally going to meet up with a few of my friends who were taking an overnight bus to Edinburgh, but they ended up getting on the wrong bus, having to have a 4 hour layover somewhere in the middle of the country, and didn't end up getting to Scotland until about 3pm that day. So I spent most of the morning walking around the city going to all of the main landmarks (usually when I'm with other people they always complain about me wanting to walk everywhere instead of trying to take a bus or metro, so I took advantage of this opportunity to walk EVERYWHERE). My general strategy when visiting a city is usually to just open up Google Maps and go to all of the landmarks that are labeled and any green patches on the map because that usually means there's a park there and the area is pretty. So far it's generally worked out pretty well haha. Some highlights included Colton Hill, Edinburgh Castle, Princes Street Gardens, and the Royal Mile.

That evening was the Thanksgiving dinner. It was hosted at an event venue on the Royal Mile, a street in the historic part of town that leads to the city's castle. We had a three course meal followed by lessons in Scottish dancing. The appetizer contained haggis, which contains a sheep's heart, liver, and lungs. I didn't know what it was before eating it and thought it was pretty good actually. I just think I would have been better off not knowing what's inside it...

The next morning, we got up early to hike up Arthur's Seat! It's a mountain that's right in the middle of Edinburgh and has really good views of the city and the ocean. It was cool watching the sun rise from the top of the peak – definitely worth getting up early for. After that, we did more sightseeing.

The city is divided distinctly into Old Town and New Town. The New Town contains a lot of modern buildings and shops, while the Old Town has a lot of old-looking stone buildings. The whole city reminded me so much of Harry Potter. JK Rowling actually lived in Edinburgh while she was writing Harry Potter. There's a cafe called the Elephant Room where she did a lot of her writing and next to it, a cemetery called Greyfriars Kirkland which has some tombstones with names that <a href="http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/voldemort-draws-harry-potter-fans-to-greyfriars-1-3067986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired some of the names of characters in the books</a>.

Edinburgh wasn't exactly a city that was on my radar – I probably wouldn't have booked a trip there had it not been for the fact that the UC program was having an event there and would reimburse part of our travel – but I'm so glad I went! It's such a beautiful city, like something out of a book. Probably one of my favorite cities of the places I've traveled so far!
