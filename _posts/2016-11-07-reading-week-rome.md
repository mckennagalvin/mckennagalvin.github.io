Long time no see! I just got back from Reading Week, which is a week in the middle of the semester with no class, meant to give students time to catch up on their studies (a.k.a time to travel!¬†üòè) I traveled to Rome, Florence, Pisa, and Barcelona with a few other study abroad students! Here are some photos from the 4 days we spent in Rome:

On Saturday, we got up at 3 a.m. for an early flight to Rome out of Stansted airport. I only took a backpack full of clothes and tote bag on the trip, which meant that I ended up wearing a lot of the same clothes most of the trip. Everyone was pretty smelly by the end of the trip haha, but it ended up being good because we had to carry around our stuff so much throughout the week.

The hostel we booked was near the train station, so we went there first to drop off our stuff, then explored the city a bit, hitting up some of the main tourist spots like the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. We then got some pasta and gelato to eat, then went back to the hostel to sleep because we hadn't gotten much the night before.

  This was the elevator in the hostel. It was kind of sketchy.¬†We did not go on said elevator.

In the middle of the night, I awoke to hear one of the friends I was traveling with asking for a plastic bag so she could catch a bed bug that was on her bed. She was able to catch it to have as proof, and started looking for other hotels in the area for the two other nights we were going to be there because she was getting bit in her sleep. The next morning, we went to the reception to let them know that we were leaving due to the bed bugs and to ask for a refund.

Long story short, the man at the front desk was not being very cooperative and thank goodness two of the people I was traveling with were willing to argue with him because I would have not been able to handle that confrontation. The whole place was pretty sketchy... the room was nice, but the hallways and reception areas were pretty run down and they made us pay for everything up front in cash when we checked in. The whole thing seemed a bit off... needless to say, we were pretty happy when we were able to get out of there!

ALSO, while all of this was happening, Rome had an earthquake! It took me a while to register that it was happening since I never really associated earthquakes as being a possibility outside of California. It was quite the morning haha.¬†While we were trying to take transportation over to our new hotel, the metro had been closed down to check for damage from the earthquake, so the buses were even more packed than usual. I have never seen something that crowded... and I've experienced the tube during rush hour!

We finally got over to our hotel and checked in. It was in a less central location than the hostel was (east of the Vatican), but it was nice, had a free breakfast buffet, and most importantly no bed bugs! So everything ended up working out :) During the rest of the day, we did some more sightseeing (the Colusseum, Piazza Venezia, Pantheon, etc.). And of course, ended the day with some Italian food and gelato (I don't think I ate any vegetables throughout the entire week... When I got back, I bought solely veggies to try to make up for that week of cheese and bread haha. No ragrets thooooo).

On Monday, we made plans to visit the Vatican Museums. The place opens at 9am, so we got in line at around 8:30am. I knew that there was going to be a line, but I had thought that since it wasn't peak season that it might be a little better.

We ended up waiting 5 and a half hours.

I will never complain about the length of any line again. Ever.

Even though it took a while, waiting in the line wasn't all bad! We ended up standing next to the nicest Italian family and I tried to practice my 5 weeks worth of Italian with them. They talked to us about Genoa, the city that they're from, and where their favorite places in Italy are. It was nice to be able to get to know their family while we stood in line together and ended up being one of the highlights of the day for me.¬†Everyone we encountered in Italy was so nice and welcoming!

We finally got inside the Vatican Museums in the afternoon, for only 8 Euro with a student ID (sometimes it pays to wait the line I guess...?)¬†I had only vague recollections of the place from when I went with my family, so it was cool being able to see it all again. They really pack the art in there! I think I read somewhere that the Vatican museums have 9 miles of artwork and if you spent one minute looking at every piece of art inside the museum, it would take you 4 years to get through everything. That place is unreal.

The next day, we checked out of our hotel then went into the city for some more sightseeing. We spent some time around Villa Borghese, which is a large park area near the north west part of the city. They had a lake there where you could rent a boat for 3 Euros a person to paddle around. After spending some time there, we went to the train station to travel to Florence, which I'll talk about in my next post!
