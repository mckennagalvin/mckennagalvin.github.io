Today is Thanksgiving, and for the first time I’m spending it away from my family. I was watching snapchats from people back in the US going home for the holidays and felt so weird having to actually go to class today — I definitely miss having a Thanksgiving break! Today especially reminded me of how quickly the time has passed; it seems like just yesterday I was moving in to my London flat, and now I have less than a month left here.

Luckily, living with a lot of Americans means I don’t have to miss out on a Thanksgiving dinner while abroad. We had a feast of our own tonight, each contributing different dishes to the meal and introducing our Australian and British flatmates to the quintessential American holiday.

Every day that I’m in London, I think about how lucky I am to be here. Having the opportunity to travel and to obtain an education is a tremendous privilege — something that is definitely not lost on me. These are just a few of the things I am grateful this Thanksgiving (some more serious than others!):

<ul>
<li>For having a family that is so loving and supportive of everything I choose to do. And for being the sole readership base of this blog haha</li>
<li>For Trader Joe's</li>
<li>For friends back home and the ones I’ve made here in London. It’s crazy to think that just two months ago I arrived in this country knowing absolutely nobody. I have made so many memories with the people I have met here and will miss them so much!</li>
<li>For my health and the health of those I care about</li>
<li>For London public transportation</li>
<li>For the privilege of being able to receive an education and attend college</li>
<li>For having the financial means to travel and for not having cost be a major prohibitive factor in endeavors which I wish to pursue</li>
<li>For ice cream</li>
<li>For having a source of employment after graduation</li>
<li>For having a place to live and a home to return to</li>
<li>For the dollar-pound exchange rate</li>
<li>For everyone that makes me smile and laugh</li>
</ul>

THANKS for reading, and I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving!
