Here's a bit of what I've been up to this week!

This past Tuesday I visited <a href="https://skygarden.london/sky-garden">Sky Garden</a>. It's a glass terrace which has views of the entire city, and it's free to visit if you reserve a time slot early enough in advance! We walked around the terrace for a bit then grabbed something to eat from the coffee bar there. I can only imagine how beautiful everything must look from up there as the sun sets -- definitely a place I'd want to return to!

Since all of the major museums in London are free, I've been squeezing in visits to some of them between my classes. It's cool that everything is accessible to the public like that (even if I do get bored of looking at paintings easily and end up only spending 30 minutes or so at each one haha). If I'm not at home during lunch time, I usually grab something to eat at Borough market, which is a food market near London Bridge which has a variety of shops and stalls (think food truck type food). It's been around since the year 1014!!!! There are always street performers around so it's nice to sit and watch people sing while I eat lunch.

Last night, there was an event at the Tate Britain (another museum) for some new art installation or something, so I went with a few of my flatmates. I have never seen so many well-dressed hipster youth in one location at the same time. It was like Urban Outfitters and American Apparel had exploded onto the floor of this museum. Anyways, the event was pretty weird. One of the exhibitions was a room where people just stared at black and white boxes flashing on a screen. Another room just had metallic silver paper cut up and laid on the floor. We were over it pretty soon and left.

As we were almost home, we saw a stray cat trying to cross the street. It almost got hit, then it tried crossing the street again and almost got hit again! It's a pretty busy street, so we were so scared we were going to watch it get run over. We ended up picking the cat up, hoping it had some sort of tag or ID. It had a collar but no information/phone number on it, so tried finding a shelter to call.

Nothing was open, so we figured we would keep it overnight then try dropping it off at a shelter in the morning. We kept the cat in our flat's kitchen for about an hour or two until we got busted by the building staff and were told we had to let it go. So we took it to a more residential neighborhood away from the busy street and hoped that it had come from one of the houses over there. I hope it turned out okay!
