Last Saturday, a friend and I decided to do a quick day trip to Brighton! It's a small coastal city about an hour south of London. We made the decision to go the night before and didn't have any plans going into the day, but it ended up being a really fun trip!

The train took about an hour from the London Bridge station. It was only 7 pounds round trip, which is only slightly more than the fare I've been paying every day just to get to class on the Tube (London transportation is expensive... I was paying the equivalent of $6 - $8.50 every day before I finally got a monthly pass). I bought a 16-25 rail card for 30 pounds which gets you 30% off the price of train fares throughout the UK, so I'm trying to get my money's worth before I leave! :).

When we got there, it was raining for literally the first time since I've been here (gr8 day to go to the beach!!! lol). It cleared up after a few hours though, luckily! We spent most of the day walking around the streets and checking out little shops and thrift stores along the way. We got brunch at a place called Bill's which was really good -- they have a few locations in London that I definitely want to check out now.

Brighton has a pier area that kind of reminds me of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Once the rain cleared up it was really nice out and I got to take some pictures that turned out pretty well!
