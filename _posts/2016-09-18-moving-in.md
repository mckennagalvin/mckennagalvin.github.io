Yesterday I moved into my housing for the next 3 months, so I'll be spending most of the weekend settling in and buying all of the grocery supplies, bedding, clothing, etc. that I wasn't able to pack with me. The place I'm living at is so new and modern; I love it! I'll probably make a whole separate post on my room later, but for now, here's what I've been up to since I last posted:

The second day of orientation involved a walking tour of London in the morning and some informational sessions in the afternoon. The place we were staying at for orientation was in a neighborhood called Southwark (fun fact: it's pronounced "Suh-thuk," not "South Wark" as you would expect. We were very confused when we reached that tube station and heard a different word from what we were reading). The weather was finally gloomy and rainy like I was expecting London to be when I arrived. We toured the neighborhood a little bit and the local landmarks like Shakespeare's Globe Theater, the Tate Modern, the Shard, and the Borough Market. I still have only gotten glimpses of the more iconic London glimpses like the London Eye and Big Ben – those are a little farther west, closer to where I'll be taking class.

We had some free time in the afternoon, so I went with some people to get Nandos for dinner. Nandos is a South African, Portuguese kind of place that's really popular in the UK and is known for its chicken and sauces. We then walked over to Trafalgar Square to see a play! I hadn't been in the more touristy part of London yet, so it was interesting to see how lively the whole place was. At night, all of the lit up signs in the square make it remind me of Times Square.

The show was called <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>, and I believe it was adapted from a book of the same name. It was really uniquely done on a stage which used LED lights, projections, and very basic props to tell the story. I thought it was pretty good!

The next day, we had an hour or so presentation on academics in the UK and how they differ from the American system. We then took taxis over to our accommodation for the semester!

I'll be staying at a place called Angel Lane in the Stratford neighborhood of East London. It seems to be a newer part of London that has been built up a lot over the past few years. It's right next to the Olympic Stadium and a HUGE Westfield mall as well as a major transportation hub for buses, trains, and the underground. It's quite far from campus (about a 30 minute tube ride), but it's nice to be away from the touristy area because I feel like more of a London resident here. The building houses mostly international and postgraduate students. I spent most of the day yesterday shuttling to and from different stores, unpacking, and getting my room all set up.

There are a few other UC students living in the same complex, so I mostly spent time shopping with them as we tried to figure out what the best British brands were and which stores were best for good deals. I got bedding at Primark, which is a Forever 21/Target hybrid type place known for its REALLY cheap prices. I was able to get all my bedding, pillow, laundry basket, hangers, etc. for around 25 pounds total! I also did a little bit of grocery shopping. It's really interesting buying food here; some of the brands are the same, but they're packaged really differently and the nutritional information, serving sizes, etc. is way different. It'll definitely take some getting used to!

In the evening, there was free food downstairs and a social event to meet people who are also living in the building. People here are from all over the world, so it was interesting hearing their stories and what they think about American culture! I then took some time to get the logistics sorted out for Welcome week, signed up for events, applied for my student travel card, etc. I finally feel like I'm getting settled in and am excited for the weeks ahead!
