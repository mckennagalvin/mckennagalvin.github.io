Finished my first week of classes! So far it's been more or less similar to classes I would take at UCLA (except that everyone is a lot more interesting to listen to because they have nice accents), so that's a bit of relief. I am taking two computer science classes, one Italian class, and one philosophy (logic) class.

Before I left, I had expected London to be roughly like living in a place like New York, but with people driving on the left side of the road and speaking differently. After being here for a few days though, there are definitely a lot of more subtle cultural differences. These are some of the things that I've noticed about British life that are different from what we have in the US:

<ul>
<li>Contactless payment is everywhere, so I just use Apple Pay on my phone at most places. So convenient! When I do use my chip card, however, I don't have a pin associated with it so I always have to sign. The cashier then has to match my signature to the signature on the card, and sometimes cross reference my credit card with another ID if they're really strict. It usually throws cashiers off here because British credit cards just use a pin with the chip card to authorize it.</li>
<li>Things like pepper spray are illegal here. If you want to buy a knife, you have to be over 18 and show ID. I made the mistake of trying to buy a knife in self-checkout once, and when I tried to show my California driver's license I was told that they would only accept passports. Like I just wanted to cut onions plz :(</li>
<li>The light switches (at least in my building) go the other way. THIS GETS ME EVERY TIME. In order to turn on a switch, you have to flip it down... also, a lot of the power outlets have a switch next to them that enables/disables it in order to save energy when nothing is plugged in.</li>
<li>Grocery stores close relatively early. I'm used to having a 24 hour Ralph's close to my apartment at UCLA, so it really threw me off when I tried to get groceries at 7pm on a Sunday and discovered it was closed. On the bright side, groceries here are cheaper than they are in the US! I still miss Trader Joe's though :(</li>
<li>People dress up a lot here. You can't go by with wearing sweats/athletic clothes to class here like you can in the US. I've seen people wearing full on suits in some of my classes.</li>
<li>Public water fountains aren't really a thing. Neither are public trash cans (they exist, but there are far fewer).</li>
<li>There are no jaywalking laws. Crossing the street is terrifying because pretty much all streets are one way and it's sometimes confusing to tell which direction cars are coming from. Usually I just run really fast and hope for the best.</li>
<li>The Netflix selection is different here; so many new movies to watch!</li>
<li>There are no open container laws. When I first got here and saw people just standing in the streets outside pubs holding beers, I was so confused... Also, the student union runs its own bar,Â and a lot of the events the RAs have put on for our residence hall have had free alcohol at them. Speaking of, I still haven't met the RA for our flat... we haven't been told about any rules for the building, nor have I put down any deposit for my housing or paid any of it yet. I find it all so strange haha</li>
<li>Britain takes its fire safety VERY SERIOUSLY. In any building, you have to traverse through approximately one "fire door" per 10 feet of walking. I'm not even kidding. My building has fire alarms EVERY SINGLE WEEK. And in multiple presentations I've been given, the person speaking has casually pointed out the fire exits in the room before speaking. When I was in a building on campus, there was a sign on one of the walls saying that the rubbish bins from that hallway had been removed because they were a fire hazard.</li>
<li>Customer service isn't as good here. Waiters/waitresses are paid more of a living wage, so it's customary to tip only 10-15 percent.</li>
<li>People generally are more independent and keep to themselves. On public transportation, it's not common to talk to people, even if you're traveling together. A lot of people read or just listen to music.</li>
<li>Slang
<ul style="margin-left:40px;">
<li>queuing = waiting in line</li>
<li>top off = put money on</li>
<li>fresher = freshman/first year student</li>
<li>uni = college</li>
<li>college = high school</li>
<li>module = class</li>
<li>course/programme = major</li>
<li>rubbish = trash</li>
<li>lift = elevator</li>
<li>toilet = bathroom</li>
<li>trainers = tennis shoes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
